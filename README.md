# Mojeek Search Result Numbering User Script

## Description 

This is a simple user script which numbers each result on the [Mojeek](https://www.mojeek.com/) search results page. 

Each result is also provided a temporary link which is shown as a number sign. Clicking on the link snaps that result to the top of the page. This can be used instead of scrolling. 

## Installing 

This user script must be used in conjunction with a user script browser add-on such as [Greasemonkey for Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/). 

If you want to use something other than Greasemonkey, please read that extension's license and privacy policy before using it. 

Install the script by visiting: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/juvtib/mojeek.user.js/main/Mojeek.user.js

Your add-on should offer to install the user script. Using this method will keep the script in sync with this repository. 

## License

This user script is licensed under the Apache 2.0 license. You are free to use, copy, modify, and relicense this work.  

## Contributions

Contributions are welcome. 

Please create an issue or submit a pull request. 

In principle, I am willing to fix errors or improve the defaults. But, if you want to customize the script by making arbitrary changes then please [fork this repository](https://github.com/juvtib/mojeek.user.js/fork) or maintain a private copy of the script.
